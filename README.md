## How do I test? ##

1. In one terminal window run `npx ganache-cli --deterministic` to set up a local blockchain and a few test accounts

2. Open another terminal window and run `npx truffle test` to run test cases in all files in the test folder

3. If you want to run tests in a single file for example the buck.test.js you can run `sh test.sh`
